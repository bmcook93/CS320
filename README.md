    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Proper testing of code to ensure that exceptions are handled correctly and that the code executes as it is expected is vital for writing secure, functional code. Writing tests that cover most of the lines of code in the program is essential.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs requires a thorough understanding of their role when it comes to utilizing the software. This leads to a better concept of use cases that the software needs to accomplish, which can be translated into code that achieves that functionality.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
Software design needs a high level of attention and detail. If there is not a plan in place already, I will consider what steps I need to take to complete the program with both security and testing in mind. Required functionality is the main focus, so my first steps when it comes to writing are to have a rough outline, typically in psuedocode, that will guide me through the coding process. It's much easier to write the code with an outline in place.
